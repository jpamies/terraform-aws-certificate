# AWS Certificate Module [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jpamies/terraform-aws-certificate.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/jpamies/terraform-aws-certificate)
This repo contains a Module to create AWS certificates and validate them  using route53 with terraform.

This module allows you to create SSL certificates without interaction, 100% with terraform.

This module can be used to create wildcard certificates, certificates with multiples subdomains but won't work with certificates with different domains. Ex:

- OK -> `jpamies.com`, `*.jpamies.com`
- OK -> `jpamies.com`, `staging.jpamies.com`
- FAIL -> `jpamies.com`, `.jordi.com`

All the requested domains should be managed by the same Route53 zone.
## Requirements

- Terraform version >= 0.12.20
- Terraform AWS Provider version 4.X  (if you need to stay in 2.X pleas check the module version [https://github.com/jpamies/terraform-aws-certificate/releases/tag/1.0.2](1.0.2))

## How to use this Module

```hcl
module "certificate" {
  source                    = "jpamies/certificate/aws"
  version                   = "~>1.0"
  domain_name               = var.domain
  subject_alternative_names = var.alternate_domains
  dns_zone_id               = var.domain_zone_id
  tags                      = var.tags
}
```

Check [examples](https://github.com/jpamies/terraform-aws-certificate/tree/master/examples) to view a detailed working example.

## Terraform < 0.12 compatibility

To keep using latest stable version compatible with terraform < 0.12, [https://github.com/jpamies/terraform-aws-certificate/releases/tag/0.0.5](0.0.5). Using `~>0.0` as version you'll get all the hotfixes for old syntax.


```hcl
module "certificate" {
  source                    = "jpamies/certificate/aws"
  version                   = "~>0.1"
  domain_name               = var.domain
  subject_alternative_names = var.alternate_domains
  dns_zone_id               = var.domain_zone_id
  tags                      = var.tags
}
```
